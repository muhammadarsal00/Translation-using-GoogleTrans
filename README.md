Let me explain how the translation script works:
Import Libraries:
googletrans: This library allows us to use Google Translate.
translate_text Function:
Inputs: text (what you want to translate) and target_language (the code for the language you're translating to).
Set up Translator: Makes a new Translator object.
Do the Translation: Uses the translate feature to change the text into the chosen language.
Give Back Translated Text: Sends out the text in its new language.
main Function:
Ask User: Gets the text to translate and the language to translate it into from the user.
Show Language Choices: Gives a list of languages you can pick from and their codes using LANGUAGES.
Change the Text: Calls translate_text with what the user typed in.
Show the Result: Prints the text in its new language.
Start the Script:
This script checks if it's running as the main program. It lets people turn text into other languages. Users pick a language code and can see what languages they can choose from.
